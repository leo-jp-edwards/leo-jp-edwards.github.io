I am a London based software engineer, currently working at a London based cybersecurity startup called [Risk Ledger](https://riskledger.com/). We have the aim of securing the global supply chain by building the new gold standard of supply chain security platforms.  

I have previously worked as a data engineer at [Carnall Farrar](https://www.carnallfarrar.com/) working with the NHS on data projects, in particular the London response to Covid. I was further responsible for building on the data and analytics offering of the company which meant building a "data lakehouse" of all inpatient, outpatient, emergency and ward data for the last 5 years. This data was made available to the wider company through an intuitive UI and later through a SQL interface. The solution was built on Hive, Athena, Apache Parquet and an Airflow orchestrator.

Before CF I worked at an undisclosed hedge fund as a data engineer and a logistics company as a data scientist.

I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from UCL and an Undergraduate degree in Biological Science from Oxford University. 

It was at Oxford that my passion for technology and data science really evolved as data analysis was covered in some depth to facilitate experiments into biological cell function. Learning to code in R for data analysis was an eye-opening experience and caused me to seek out more in the way of coding experience and data analysis projects.

Over the following summer I taught myself to code in Python and began projects to learn Machine Learning techniques as well as the bread and butter tools of Python data analytics. 


After finishing my Master’s I had a strong desire to delve deeper into data science and to really challenge myself to turn my hobby into a career. This led me to the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly. There I gained the experience and knowledge to approach data problems in a structured way to gain the most valuable insights.


My interests at the moment are largely in applying my knowledge of data and computer science into a data engineering or data science setting. In particular big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational biology are my areas of interest and expertise.


I have a passion for combining my background in biology, computer science and data science. In particular in healthcare analytics which I feel is a vital and fascinating area of research to which I hope to contribute in the future.
